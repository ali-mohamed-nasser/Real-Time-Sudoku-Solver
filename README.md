# Real Time Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill (9x9) grid such that each row, and each column and the (3x3) small grid contains all of the digits between 1 to 9. And in this project we create a Sudoku solver which recognise the elements of Sudoku puzzle in the input video and providing a digital solution overlays on the top of the original image in real time (in live computer webcam) by using computer vision techniques to recognize and extract digits images from the grid and machine learning model (CNN) to get that digits detections. Sudoku Solver is the collection of very basic image processing techniques. A very good way to start is the OpenCV library which can be compiled on almost all the platforms.

# Step [1]: Technologies & Knowledges that required for this project
- 01 Python programming language:
Basic knowledge of coding and syntax formats of python is essential for this project. Python is advantageous as it easy to comprehend and consists of large number of inbult libraries that facilitate faster outputs.

- 02 OpenCV library:
Basic knowledge of opencv regarding use applications and syntax are essential here. It is a library in python that helps with computer vision and is more convenient as it provides large number of functions for conversions and processing.

- 03 Numpy library:
Basic knowledge of numpy including syntax and computational part are essentail to form image arrays. It is a lirary in pyton used to perform mathematical computation.

- 04 Convolution Neural Network (CNN):
Convolution neural network is one of the deep learning algorithm that used to classify large image data into multi classes such as classify the images of dogs and cats to 2 classes or the image of other things to many classes. You shold have basic knowledge of deep learning and CNNs because we use it in the number detection and get the right class of each number. Or you can use another type of number recognition called OCR like (pytersseract) or any other OCR, and it will do the same work.
